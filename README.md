# Simpsons Script Generation
Generating a script for a Moe's Tavern scene using a recurrent neural network with long short term memory (LSTM) cells. The dataset is a subset of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data), and includes scenes from Moe's Tavern from 27 seasons.

This is Project 3 of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. The aim of this project is generate a new Simpsons's script based on existing script data using recurrent neural networks, and go through the process of building and tuning one in TensorFlow.
